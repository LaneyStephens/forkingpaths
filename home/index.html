                    I carried out my plan because I felt the Chief had some fear of those of my race, of those
                    uncountable forebears whose culmination lies in me. I wished to prove to him that a yellow man could
                    save his armies. Besides, I had to escape the
                    Captain. His hands and voice could, at any moment, knock and beckon at my door. Silently, I dressed,
                    took leave of myself in the mirror, went down the stairs, sneaked a look at the quiet street, and
                    went out. The station was not far from
                    my house, but I thought it more prudent to take a cab. I told myself that I thus ran less chance of
                    being recognized. The truth is that, in the deserted street, I felt infinitely visible and
                    vulnerable.
